# GroupChat
An aplication that runs a server to which multiple clients can connect and, with that, log on to it. Clients can see, in a list, who else is connected to the server and start a private conversation with any of them in their particular window, they can also share any type of files with each other. Developed in Java.

The two folders above are Netbeans projects. First run the server and then as many clients as you want.
